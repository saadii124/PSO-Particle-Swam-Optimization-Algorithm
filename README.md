# PSO-Particle-Swam-Optimization-Algorithm
Our Project is based on PSO (Particle Swam Optimization) algorithm. Basically this is population based algorithm mainly used for the optimal solution of a particular problem. PSO algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling the concept of social interaction is used for solving a problem it uses a number of particles that constitute a swarm moving around in the search space for the best solution each particle in the swarm looks for its positional coordinates in the solution space ,which are associated with the best solution that has been achieved so far by that particle .Another Best value known as  or global best is tracked by PSO. This is best possible value obtained so far by any particle in the neighborhood of that particle. PSO Focus on the group of birds. This group is called ‘Swarm’. The main focus of PSO was to graphically was to graphically simulate the graceful choreography of bird flock.
